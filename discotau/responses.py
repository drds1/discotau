responses.py
=============

A small registry formalising the response-function "contract" described in
CLAUDE.md's design decisions, so swapping in a built-in alternative or a
custom response function is a one-line, discoverable operation rather than
something you have to reverse-engineer from ``model.py``/``echofit.py``.

The contract (unchanged, just named here): a response function is any
callable ``psi(tau_grid, log_mdot_msun_yr, wavelength, inclination, M_BH, **kwargs)``
returning an array the same shape as ``tau_grid`` that is causal
(``psi[tau_grid < 0] == 0``) and area-normalised on ``tau_grid``
(``trapz(psi, tau_grid) == 1``). ``transfer_coeffs``/``compute_echo`` and the
plotting code never assume anything more specific than that.

Only "physical"-mode responses (the ``log_mdot_msun_yr``/``inclination``-driven
family) are covered here -- "free"-mode's ``tophat_response_free`` takes a
different contract (an explicit ``tau_mean`` rather than the
mass-accretion-rate-and-wavelength parameters) since its whole point is an
independently inferred lag per band, so it is deliberately not part of this
registry.

Registering a response makes it look-up-able by name; it does not, on its
own, change what a fit uses. To actually use one for "physical"-mode bands,
assign it to ``discotau.model.response_function`` (both the NumPyro model and
the plotting code look this name up dynamically, so the swap is picked up
everywhere)::

    import discotau.model as model
    from discotau.responses import get_response

    model.response_function = get_response("thin_disk")

To add your own::

    from discotau.responses import register_response

    def my_response(tau_grid, log_mdot_msun_yr, wavelength, inclination, M_BH, **kw):
        ...
        return psi

    register_response("my_response", my_response)
    model.response_function = get_response("my_response")
