`forward_model.thin_disk_response` is a physically-motivated alternative to
the default skew-normal `response_function` (see the README's "Swapping the
response function" section and `CLAUDE.md`'s design decisions #5, #8
and #9). This document works through exactly how it is computed, step by step,
covers the Gaussian smoothing applied on top of the exact physics and the
trade-off that comes with it (section 5), shows the two scaling checks
worth seeing on a chart rather than taking on faith (section 6: that
inclination reshapes the response without moving its mean lag much, and
that the mean lag grows with accretion rate the way thin-disk theory says
it should), and covers the precomputed-template fast path
(`build_thin_disk_response_fast`, section 7).

The physics follows Starkey, Horne & Villforth (2016, MNRAS 456, 1960;
[arXiv:1511.06162](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06162), the CREAM paper),
which in turn cites Cackett, Horne & Winkler (2007) for the response
function derivation, and the author's PhD-era Fortran CREAM code
(`pycecream`'s `cream_f90.f90`, the `tfbx`/`tr4visc`/`tr4irad` subroutines)
for the original numerical (Monte Carlo) implementation. This is not a
line-by-line translation of either: the Fortran evaluates the response by
random sampling and Gaussian smoothing (not reproducible/differentiable in
a NUTS-friendly way), and Starkey+2016 itself evaluates it numerically too.
Section 4 below works through an exact **analytic** reduction of the
geometry and physics instead; section 5 then adds Gaussian smoothing back
on top of that exact result, for reasons that turned out to matter and are
worth reading rather than skipping.

## 1. The physical picture

A thin accretion disk reprocesses the AGN's variable ionising continuum
into thermal (viscous) and reprocessed (irradiation-heated) emission at
every radius `r` and azimuth `phi`. A patch of disk at `(r, phi)` sees the
driving continuum after a light-travel-time delay set by the disk's
geometry, and re-emits at a wavelength set by its own temperature. Summed
over the whole disk, this gives a causal, positive transfer function
`psi(tau)`, the fraction of the reprocessed response arriving with delay
`tau`, exactly what `response_function` also computes, just with the
skew-normal shape swapped out for the real geometry and temperature
physics.

## 2. Temperature profile

Two heating mechanisms are combined, each raised to the 4th power of
temperature (as radiative flux balance requires) and summed -- this is
Starkey+2016 eq. 2 exactly:

```
T**4(r) = 3GM*Mdot/(8 pi sigma r**3) * (1 - sqrt(r_in/r))     [viscous]
          + L_b*(1-a)*h_x / (4 pi sigma x**3)                  [irradiation]
```

with `x = sqrt(r**2 + h_x**2)` the distance from the lamppost (at height
`h_x` above the disk plane) to the surface element, `L_b = eta*Mdot*c**2`
the lamppost's bolometric luminosity, `a` the disk albedo, and `r_in` the
innermost stable circular orbit, **3 Schwarzschild radii for a
non-spinning black hole** -- confirmed against both the published paper's
own statement of this ("`rin` is the innermost stable circular orbit
(3 rs for a Schwarzschild black hole)") and the Fortran's own default
(`rinld = 3*f_rs2ld(rinsch, embh)` with the active default `urin = 1.0`,
i.e. `rinsch=1` giving exactly 3 Schwarzschild radii too -- there's a
separate, *commented-out* `urin = 3.0` line in the Fortran that would give
9 Rs instead, but it isn't the one actually used).

**Viscous heating**, with an inner boundary term that drives the
temperature smoothly to zero at `r_in`:

```
T_visc**4(r) = K_visc * (1 - sqrt(r_in / r)) / r**3
```

**Lamppost irradiation** (`include_irradiation=True`, the default since
October 2026; see below): the *true*
lamppost geometry above, not a `~1/r**3` far-field approximation used in
an earlier draft of this function -- the two forms only agree for `r >>
h_x`, and `h_x` defaults to 3 Schwarzschild radii, the same order of
magnitude as `r_in` itself, so the difference matters exactly in the
regime this function spends the most time in:

```
T_irr**4(r) = K_irr * h_x / (r**2 + h_x**2)**1.5
```

`h_x` (`lamppost_height_rs`, default 3.0, Starkey+2016's own illustrative
value) is expressed in Schwarzschild radii and converted to light-days via
the same `M_BH`-based helper as `r_in`. The two terms are combined as
`T**4(r) = w * T_irr**4(r) + (1-w) * T_visc**4(r)` for a mixing weight `w`
(`irradiation_weight`, default 0.5: irradiation's share of `T**4` at each
band's Wien radius), or the viscous term alone with
`include_irradiation=False`.

**Why irradiation is on by default.** With the viscous term alone, the
zero-torque factor `(1 - sqrt(r_in/r))` makes the innermost disk cool, and
the response weighting (the Planck derivative times `T**-3`, times the
lamppost's `h_x/d**3` dilution) makes cool gas next to the lamppost
respond strongly. The response then peaks at the disk's inner edge in every
band: a sharp spike at a fixed, wavelength-independent delay (about 0.25
days for Fairall 9's `M_BH = 2.55e8`), which no published response function
shows. CREAM's `tfbx` avoids it by leaving the zero-torque factor out of the
temperature it uses for the response weighting. Irradiation keeps the
inner disk hot instead, so the spike goes and the peak moves out with
wavelength (Fairall 9, face-on: 0.54 days at 2055 A and 2.2 days at 5425 A
with `w = 0.5`, against CREAM's 0.70 and 2.4 days at the same `T_1`). The
mean and median delays, which carry the lag-spectrum information, change
much less than the peak. `tests/test_thin_disk_response.py`'s
`test_default_response_has_no_inner_edge_spike` checks this. Fits made
before the change used the viscous-only response; pass
`include_irradiation=False` to reproduce them.

Both `K_visc` and `K_irr`'s radial *power-law index* (`viscous_slope`,
`irradiation_slope`, default 0.75 each, the standard thin-disk value, and
what eq. 2 reduces to for `r >> r_in, h_x`) are fixed, not inferred,
matching `response_function`'s existing convention of fixed shape
hyperparameters.

**Absolute calibration -- a deliberate departure from the Fortran.** The
Fortran derives `K_visc`/`K_irr` from `G`, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,
and a physical `Mdot` (itself derived from an Eddington ratio via
`myedrat2mdot`). Doing the same here would give `log_mdot` two different,
incompatible physical meanings depending which response function a band
used. Instead, `thin_disk_response` reuses
`forward_model.lag_scaling(log_mdot, wavelength, M_BH)` -- the same
function `response_function` uses -- to fix a characteristic radius
`r_ref` (in light-days), and Wien's displacement law,
`wavelength * T = b`, to fix the temperature at that radius. This ties the
two response families together: switching a band from `response_function`
to `thin_disk_response` keeps `log_mdot`'s meaning the same. Only the
disk's inner edge and the lamppost height use real physical constants (G,
c, M_sun) directly, since that conversion needs no accretion-rate
calibration at all.

One consequence worth being explicit about: because `r_ref` is only a
*characteristic* radius, not a promise about the resulting response's
actual mean, `thin_disk_response`'s empirical mean lag comes out somewhat
larger than `lag_scaling`'s pivot value (the physical response has real
weight extending well beyond `r_ref`) -- see the worked numbers in
section 6. `response_function`'s mean lag isn't exactly the pivot value
either, for the same reason (a skew-normal's mean isn't its `loc`
parameter once it's skewed). `lag_scaling` fixes the *scale*, not the
*exact* mean, for either response family.

## 3. Delay surface

A patch of disk at radius `r` and azimuth `phi` (measured from the
observer's line of sight projected onto the disk plane) is farther from
the observer, by light-travel time, than the disk's centre by (Starkey+2016
eq. 5):

```
tau(r, phi) = r * (1 + cos(phi) * sin(inclination))
```

Face-on (`inclination = 0`), every azimuth has the same delay `r`,
whatever the radius, so the whole ring at radius `r` contributes at a
single lag. Inclined, the near side (`cos(phi) = -1`) arrives earlier and
the far side (`cos(phi) = +1`) later than the ring's mean -- this is what
gives the response its inclination-dependent skew, exactly as
Starkey+2016 describes it: "Tilting the disc makes the response function
more skewed; it peaks at shorter lags and develops a tail toward large
lags." Critically, `integral_0^{2 pi} cos(phi) dphi = 0`, so **the ring's
mean delay is `r` regardless of inclination**: inclination reshapes the
response around a fixed mean -- the same requirement `response_function`
satisfies by construction (`CLAUDE.md` decision #4), and the paper states
explicitly too ("The mean delay... is independent of inclination"). Note
that `h_x` (the lamppost height) does *not* appear in the delay surface --
matching eq. 5 exactly -- only in the temperature profile above.

> **Update (September 2026): the delay now includes the lamppost height.**
> Measured from the direct ray, the delay is
> `tau = sqrt(r**2 + h_x**2) + h_x cos(inclination) + r cos(phi) sin(inclination)`.

This exact-independence claim is a property of the *unsmoothed* geometry
worked through here and in section 4. Section 5's default smoothing
loosens it to an approximate one -- see that section for exactly how much,
and why.

## 4. Response weight and the analytic disk integral

Each `(r, phi)` patch's contribution to `psi(tau)` is weighted by how
strongly its emission responds, in the observing band, to a small heating
perturbation: the Planck function's derivative with respect to
temperature,

```
X = hc / (k * wavelength * T(r))
weight(r) = X**5 * exp(X) / (exp(X) - 1)**2
```

times the disk-plane area element `r dr dphi`. Putting the last three
sections together, the full disk integral is:

```
psi_raw(tau) = integral_{r_in}^{infinity} integral_0^{2 pi}
                   weight(r) * delta(tau - tau(r, phi)) * r dr dphi
```

with `delta` a Dirac delta picking out exactly the `(r, phi)` patches that
land at each `tau`.

**This integral has an exact closed form in `r`, with no approximation
needed.** At *fixed* `phi`, `tau(r, phi) = r * (1 + cos(phi)
sin(inclination))` is *linear* in `r`, so the delta function collapses the
radial integral onto a single root,

```
r*(phi, tau) = tau / (1 + cos(phi) * sin(inclination))
```

with Jacobian `d(tau)/dr = 1 + cos(phi) sin(inclination)` (constant in
`r`, at fixed `phi`), leaving:

```
psi_raw(tau) = tau * integral_0^{2 pi}
                   weight(r*(phi, tau)) / (1 + cos(phi) sin(inclination))**2 dphi
```

a plain 1-D integral over a *fixed* `phi` grid (`n_phi`, evenly spaced),
evaluated the same way for every `tau_grid` point via a uniform Riemann
sum -- exact for a periodic integrand, no `trapz` edge correction needed.
This raw result is normalised to unit area on `tau_grid`, and zeroed for
`tau < 0` (automatically satisfied by the geometry: `tau(r, phi) >= r(1 -
sin(inclination)) >= 0` for `inclination <= 90` degrees). The only masking
needed is excluding `r* < r_in` (no disk material inside the ISCO), done
with a *smooth* sigmoid rather than a hard cutoff, since `r*` depends on
`inclination`, a sampled parameter, and a hard `jnp.where` there would
carry the same zero-gradient risk already documented for
`tophat_response_free` (`CLAUDE.md` decision #7).

**This replaces an earlier two-radial-grid, Gaussian-kernel-deposit
implementation entirely**, which needed a separate log-spaced radial grid
(`n_r`) and a domain cutoff (`r_max_factor`) to avoid visible quadrature
artefacts -- worst exactly at high inclination, where the naive radial
domain a face-on response needs blows up by two to three orders of
magnitude (documented at length in git history and the superseded parts of
`CLAUDE.md` decision #8, kept there as a record of what was tried and why
it wasn't good enough, not as current guidance). None of that grid/cutoff
machinery is needed here: there is no radial grid to under-resolve and no
truncation to get wrong, because the radial integral was never
approximated -- it was solved. Removing the radial dimension also drops
the cost from `O(n_r * n_phi * n_tau)` to `O(n_phi * n_tau)`, with
`n_phi=200` (the current default) already fully converged where the old
implementation needed `n_r=400` *and* still showed residual artefacts at
extreme inclination or accretion rate. (An early draft of this section
also quoted a specific "~25x faster" number for this step; that was
measured the wrong way -- see section 7's methodology-correction note --
and isn't repeated here since the old grid implementation no longer
exists to re-measure properly.)

## 5. Gaussian smoothing: a deliberate reintroduction

Section 4's `psi_raw` is exact for the idealised model (a razor-thin disk
with a well-defined temperature at every point). Plotted directly, though,
a second user report flagged that high-inclination curves still didn't
look like Starkey+2016 Figure 3's skewed-Gaussian-like shapes -- instead
showing a sharp near-zero-lag spike (confirmed: a single, genuine local
maximum right at `tau=0`, from the disk's near-side tangent line, not a
numerical artefact) followed by an abrupt change in decay rate a bit
further out (confirmed: no interior local minimum, i.e. not literally two
separate humps with a dip between them, but enough of a kink to look
wrong).

Asked directly, at the user's prompting, whether the original Fortran
smoothed the response and whether that was implemented here: it does, and
it wasn't. Confirmed directly in `cream_f90.f90`, in *both*
response-function subroutines -- `tfbx`'s `sig_gaus = dtau` and the older
`tfb`'s `sig_g = dtau/2` -- applied not as numerical artefact clean-up but
as part of the physical model itself: every individual disk element's
contribution is deposited as a Gaussian spread across several tau bins
(`tfbx` lines ~12604-12714: the nested radius/azimuth loop computes each
grid point's `taulag` and `resp`, then spreads `resp` across
`iblo:ibhi` with Gaussian weights
`exp(-((taulag-taubin)/sig_gaus)**2 / 2)`), not a single delta-function
spike at its own exact delay.

**Smoothing each element's contribution individually and summing is
mathematically identical to computing section 4's exact integral once and
convolving *that* with the same Gaussian**, because Gaussian smoothing is
linear and `sig_gaus` is one constant for the whole disk, not varying
grid point to grid point -- not an approximation of the per-element
version, just a cheaper way to compute the same result. `smoothing_days`
implements exactly that: a single, explicit convolution of the exact
curve, re-applying the causal (`tau >= 0`) mask afterwards, since
smoothing spreads some weight from the `tau >= 0` side across the
boundary.

**The Fortran's literal `sig_gaus = dtau` convention doesn't transplant
directly**: it only smooths meaningfully because the Fortran's typical
output grids were coarse, making `dtau` incidentally comparable to a
significant fraction of a day; for a finer `tau_grid` (confirmed with an
800-point grid: `dtau` ~0.01 days) it's negligible, and it ties the disk's
own physical smoothing to an unrelated resolution choice regardless.
`smoothing_frac` (default 0.1; 0.4 until September 2026, see below) instead scales the smoothing width as
`smoothing_frac * tau_ref` (`tau_ref` from `lag_scaling`), chosen by
directly comparing rendered curves against Starkey+2016 Figure 3 (fetched
and rendered from the actual PDF, not just read from the caption text) --
smaller fractions leave a visible kink at high inclination; larger ones
start smoothing away genuine inclination-driven skew differences between
bands.

**This reintroduces a real, quantified trade-off with decision #4/section
3's exact mean-lag independence, resolved with the user directly rather
than picked unilaterally.** Smoothing enough to match the published shape
costs mean-lag drift with inclination -- monotonic in `smoothing_frac`:
0% unsmoothed, ~3% at 0.1, ~6% at 0.2, ~10% at the default 0.4 (face-on to
80 degrees). A reflecting-boundary kernel (folding smoothed-away mass at
`tau=0` back in, rather than discarding it) was tried specifically to see
if it would restore exactness, and does not: the drift turns out to be
inherent to any causally-respecting smoothing near a boundary that
high-inclination responses sit much closer to than face-on ones, not an
artefact of discarding vs redistributing leaked mass. Presented this
quantified trade-off directly; the choice was to keep `smoothing_frac=0.4`
(matching the published look) as the default over a smaller value or
defaulting to exact. `smoothing_days=0.0` disables smoothing entirely and
recovers section 3/4's exact behaviour, for anyone who wants that back --
see `tests/test_thin_disk_response.py`'s
`test_thin_disk_response_smoothing_days_zero_gives_exact_mean_lag_independence`
and `test_thin_disk_response_default_smoothing_mean_lag_drift_is_bounded`.

**Update (September 2026): the default is now `smoothing_frac=0.1`.** The 0.4 above was tuned
against responses that lacked the lamppost's `h/x**3` dilution and were far broader than they
should have been. On the corrected, compact responses 0.4 smooths over more than the mean delay:
it raises mean delays ~25% and erases most of the inclination information, which the NGC 5548
analysis measured directly. At 0.1 the mean delay drifts ~7% face-on to 80 degrees; the drift
figures above (3%, 6%, 10%) are for the old, too-broad responses. The author chose 0.1.

## 6. Verification: the two scaling-law charts

Both figures use a case-study disk with `M_BH = 1e8` solar masses and
`wavelength = 5000` Angstrom (the same pivot values used throughout
`forward_model.py` and the test suite), generated by
`scripts/plot_thin_disk_response_scalings.py` with the default smoothing
on; rerun it to regenerate these PNGs if `thin_disk_response`'s physics or
defaults change.

### Inclination sweep (fixed accretion rate)

`log_mdot = 0` throughout; only inclination varies.

![thin_disk_response, varying inclination](images/thin_disk_response_inclination_sweep.png)

| inclination (deg) | mean lag (days, numerically integrated) |
|---:|---:|
| 0  | 0.585 |
| 20 | 0.583 |
| 40 | 0.577 |
| 60 | 0.568 |
| 80 | 0.558 |

*Updated September 2026, for the current response (causal smoothing and the
lamppost height in the delay).*

- **Each response starts at its lamppost-delay onset,** with no response
  before it.
- **The near side's contribution sharpens into a spike at high
  inclination.** A small shoulder at 40 to 60 degrees, where the near- and
  far-side contributions merge, is visible now that the smoothing no longer
  hides it.
- **The mean lags fall by 0.027 days from face-on to 80 degrees.** That is
  the lamppost term $h_x(\cos 0 - \cos 80^\circ) = 0.029$ days for this
  $10^8\mkern3mu M_\odot$ disc, to within quadrature error, so
  $\langle\tau\rangle - h_x\cos i$ is flat to about 0.5 per cent.
- **The old Gaussian in τ** (section 5) raised the means to about 1.9 days
  and made them drift about 10 per cent upwards with inclination. It was
  also tuned for a response that lacked the lamppost dilution.

### Accretion-rate sweep (fixed face-on inclination)

`inclination = 0` throughout; only `log_mdot` varies.

![thin_disk_response, varying mdot](images/thin_disk_response_mdot_sweep.png)

| log_mdot | mdot | mean lag (days) | `lag_scaling` reference radius (days) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| -1.0 | 0.10 | 0.302 | 0.464 |
| -0.5 | 0.32 | 0.415 | 0.681 |
| +0.0 | 1.00 | 0.585 | 1.000 |
| +0.5 | 3.16 | 0.841 | 1.468 |
| +1.0 | 10.00 | 1.223 | 2.154 |

*Updated September 2026, for the current response (causal smoothing and the
lamppost height in the delay).*

The mean lag grows monotonically with `mdot`, close to the `mdot**(1/3)`
scaling that `lag_scaling` uses. From `log_mdot=-1` to `+1` it grows by a
factor of 4.05, against an ideal `100**(1/3) = 4.64`. The difference comes
from the fixed-size terms: the inner-boundary term in section 2 and the
lamppost height (about 0.035 light-days here). Both matter most for the
smallest discs, and both bend the pure power law as they would for a real
disk. The means are about 0.6 times `lag_scaling`'s reference radius, which
is the lag-temperature relation with `y_eff` of about 3.2 (see
`test_thin_disk_mean_lag_obeys_the_standard_lag_temperature_relation`).
The old table here, with means of 1.9 times the reference radius, predated
the lamppost-dilution fix. As section 2 already flags, the
empirical mean lag sits above the `lag_scaling` reference radius at every
`mdot` -- `lag_scaling` fixes the response's characteristic scale, not its
exact mean.

## 7. A precomputed, interpolated fast path for MCMC

Even with section 4's analytic reduction, NUTS calls a band's response
function on every leapfrog step of every sample, so there is still a real
cost to recomputing the full integral (plus section 5's smoothing
convolution) that often when only `log_mdot` and `inclination` change
step to step, not the disk's physics.

`build_thin_disk_response_table` / `build_thin_disk_response_fast`
implement the same fix the author used for this in the PhD-era CREAM
Fortran code (confirmed directly in `cream_f90.f90`: a `psistore(:,ist)`
array precomputed once across an inclination grid, `degstore = (ist-1) *
ddeginc`, at one fixed reference `umdotref`/`wavref`): precompute the
response once, on a grid of inclinations, at one reference accretion rate;
then get any other inclination by interpolating that grid, and any other
accretion rate (or wavelength) by *stretching* the lag axis according to
the `mdot**(1/3)` / `wavelength**(4/3)` scaling `lag_scaling` already uses,
rather than recomputing the disk integral at all:

```python
import discotau.model as model
from discotau.forward_model import build_thin_disk_response_fast

model.response_function = build_thin_disk_response_fast(M_BH=1e8)
```

Concretely, for a given `(log_mdot, wavelength, inclination)`:

1. **Interpolate over inclination** (`jnp.interp`, linear, differentiable
   in `inclination` almost everywhere) against the precomputed template
   family, giving one dimensionless template on the table's own lag axis.
2. **Stretch** that template by `s = lag_scaling(log_mdot, wavelength,
   M_BH) / tau_ref_reference`: evaluate it at `tau_grid / s` and divide by
   `s` to keep the area normalised to 1 under that change of variables.
3. **Smooth**, at this query's own `tau_ref` (not the table's reference
   point).

Step 3 has to come *after* step 2, not be baked into the table: templates
are built unsmoothed (`smoothing_days=0.0` internally), and
`thin_disk_response_from_table` smooths once, post-stretch, with its own
`smoothing_frac`/`smoothing_days` (same defaults as `thin_disk_response`'s,
overridable independently of whatever `build_thin_disk_response_table`'s
own kwargs were). Smoothing *before* stretching would stretch the
smoothing bandwidth right along with everything else, silently coupling
two things that should be independent -- confirmed to matter a lot when
first wired the other way round: even the near-reference-point case (which
should be almost exact) was off by ~13% at the peak; doing it in this
order brings that back under 1%.

Both interpolation steps are lookups against fixed tables, `O(n_u +
n_tau)` rather than `O(n_phi * n_tau)`, plus the same `O(n_tau^2)`
smoothing convolution `thin_disk_response` itself now also pays for.

**A methodology correction, worth being upfront about:** every speed
number in earlier drafts of this section (and of `CLAUDE.md`'s matching
design decisions) was measured with plain, eager (non-`jax.jit`) repeated
Python calls -- not what actually happens inside a NUTS fit, where
NumPyro `jax.jit`-compiles the whole log-density function once and every
leapfrog step reuses that compiled executable, none of eager timing's
per-call Python dispatch overhead included. Checked directly: at
`n_tau=600`, an eager call to `thin_disk_response` took ~134ms; the exact
same call through `jax.jit` took ~2.6ms, a ~50x gap that has nothing to
do with either function's real cost. The old "~90x -> ~4x -> ~1.3-1.5x"
progression this section used to report is unreliable as a result, and
in fact went the *wrong direction* at at least one point: re-measured
under `jax.jit`, right after section 4's analytic rewrite but before this
section's smoothing was reintroduced, the fast path was actually **~13x
faster**, not the ~4x the eager measurement had claimed.

**Properly measured now** (`jax.jit`, `n_tau=400`, matching
`EchoFit.build_grid()`'s own default): `thin_disk_response` (with default
smoothing) costs ~1.5ms per call, the templated fast path ~0.55ms --
**~2.8x faster**, with a range of roughly 2x-5x depending on `n_tau`
(checked at 150/400/600; precomputing the table itself still takes ~3
seconds regardless). Smoothing itself turns out to add real, non-negligible
cost once jitted (~1.5x over `smoothing_days=0.0`, where the eager
measurement had suggested it was nearly free). Both `thin_disk_response`
variants remain substantially more expensive than the closed-form
`response_function` even fast and jitted -- ~12x for the templated path,
~34x for the plain one, at the same settings -- confirming this is an
inherent cost of doing a real disk integral rather than an assumed
closed-form shape, not something either optimisation removes. Still a
real, essentially-free win at call time over the plain version, worth
reaching for on long runs where every bit of per-step cost compounds, but
not a way to make `thin_disk_response` competitive with the skew-normal's
cost -- see `CLAUDE.md` decision #9 for a note on a banded/truncated
smoothing kernel that was prototyped and found faster still, but has a
real edge-handling bug and wasn't pursued given how small the absolute
costs already are once properly jitted. Gradients w.r.t. `log_mdot` and
`inclination` are still non-zero (checked with `jax.grad`, including at
an inclination *not* on the precomputed grid, the same discipline used
for `thin_disk_response` and `tophat_response_free`'s gradients elsewhere
in this codebase).

**The stretch is still an approximation, not an identity, independent of
smoothing.** The disk isn't *exactly* self-similar under it: `r_in` (the
ISCO) is a fixed absolute length, so it doesn't stretch along with
everything else, meaning `r_in / tau_ref` -- and with it, how much the
inner boundary term shapes the response -- genuinely differs between the
table's reference point and wherever a fit actually queries it. In
practice this still shows up most wherever the response is sharpest: at
high inclination, near the near-zero-lag feature from the disk's near
side.

*Updated September 2026, for the current response.*

- **Near the table's reference point** (`log_mdot=0`, `wavelength=5000`
  Angstrom), the two curves are visually indistinguishable.
- **Far from it** (`inclination=85` degrees, `wavelength=7000` Angstrom,
  `log_mdot=-0.5`), the fast path now overshoots the exact near-side spike by
  about 30 per cent of the peak, while the tail agrees to a few per cent. It
  was 0.7 per cent before the causal smoothing replaced the Gaussian in τ.
  - The old smoothing blurred the spike on both curves alike, hiding their
    difference.
  - Unsmoothed, the spike is shaped by fixed-size parts of the disk: the
    inner edge and, now, the lamppost height in the delay. The stretch cannot
    reproduce these (see above).
  - This figure's lag grid, 0.03 days, is also coarse for a spike a few
    hundredths of a day wide.

The fast path is opt-in and used by nothing by default. If a fit's posterior is expected to live mostly at
high inclination and/or spans multiple bands at very different
wavelengths, building the table with `reference_wavelength` set closer to
the run's own wavelength(s) narrows this further; using the exact
`thin_disk_response` directly removes it entirely, at the ~2-5x per-step
cost difference from above. This tradeoff, not a hidden
bug, is exactly what
`tests/test_thin_disk_response_fast.py::test_fast_response_approximation_degrades_away_from_reference`
checks for.

## 8. API summary

```python
from discotau.forward_model import thin_disk_response, build_thin_disk_response_fast
from discotau.responses import get_response
import discotau.model as model

# use the exact disk integral directly (default: smoothed, see section 5)
psi = thin_disk_response(tau_grid, log_mdot, wavelength, inclination, M_BH)

# unsmoothed / exact mean-lag-independence version
psi_exact = thin_disk_response(tau_grid, log_mdot, wavelength, inclination, M_BH, smoothing_days=0.0)

# or swap it in for "physical"-mode bands (see CLAUDE.md decision #5)
model.response_function = get_response("thin_disk")

# or use the precomputed-template fast path (section 7) for a real fit --
# now a smaller win than it used to be, since thin_disk_response itself
# got much cheaper, but still free performance with a documented accuracy
# tradeoff
model.response_function = build_thin_disk_response_fast(M_BH=1e8)
```
